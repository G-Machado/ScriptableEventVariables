# Scriptable Event Variables
Variables event system for Unity3D development.

Implemented with Unity’s Scriptable Objects (SO), this system is designed to remove dependencies between variables and object oriented scripts.
Supported by SO’s folder reference and Unity Events, the Scriptable Event Variables system can easily connect gameplay functionality and UI fields with core data.
Everytime a value is changed, listener scripts will respond to trigged events that can be both configured through inspector and/or method overrides.
